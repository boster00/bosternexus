# Boster Nexus Cursor Rules (Architecture Constitution)

## 0) Branding Guidelines
**CRITICAL: Customer-facing branding rules**
- Brand name: **Boster** or **Boster Bio** (NEVER "BosterNexus" in customer UI)
- Domain: bosterbio.com
- "Boster Nexus" is the internal system name for the platform/business intelligence system
- All customer-facing UI, emails, documents MUST use "Boster" or "Boster Bio"
- Internal code, logs, system names may use "BosterNexus" or "Nexus"
- Repository name "bosternexus" is acceptable for internal reference only

## A) Repo boundaries
- Next.js pages/layouts/routes MUST NOT implement business logic.
- Next.js pages/layouts/routes may only call `/src/client-api/*` methods (or facades exposed by that client).
- Next.js code MUST NOT import from `apps/api/**` or any backend internal folders.

## B) Backend layering (NestJS)
- Controllers contain no business logic. They only: validate DTOs, call facades, return responses.
- Application/use-case orchestration lives in `src/application/**`.
- Domain logic lives in `src/domain/**` and must not depend on HTTP, DB, or integrations.
- Integration clients live in `src/integrations/**` and are the only place external APIs are called.

## C) External calls
- Do NOT use fetch/axios/raw HTTP directly outside `ExternalApiClient`.
- All external API calls MUST go through `ExternalApiClient` or a client that composes it.
- Zoho calls MUST go through `ZohoBooksClient` / `ZohoCrmClient` (no scattered Zoho calls).
- FedEx calls MUST go through `FedexClient` (no scattered shipping calls).

## D) Context
- Use AsyncLocalStorage request context in NestJS only.
- Code MAY call `Context.current()` only in:
  - controllers, facades, orchestrators, integration clients, logging/analytics
- Code MUST NOT use Context.current() inside core domain logic (pricing/promotions/cart math).
- Never store or log secrets or raw tokens in context.

## E) Idempotency + transactions
- Any operation that creates/mutates external state MUST require an idempotency key.
- Checkout/order flows MUST use TransactionService state transitions; do not set states ad hoc.

## F) Mapping + DTOs
- All external field mappings (Zoho, FedEx, etc.) MUST live in dedicated Mapper classes.
- Do not repeat mapping logic across multiple services.

## G) Logging + errors
- Use structured JSON logging with requestId/sessionId/userId when available.
- Redact PII/secrets in logs.
- Do not throw raw errors from application services; use standardized AppError/Result pattern.

## H) Scope control (Phase 1)
- Do NOT implement full PIM/CMS/admin/SEO systems unless explicitly requested.

## I) Product image organization
- Product images use Magento-style SKU-based subfolder structure.
- Images are organized by first two letters of SKU (lowercase).
- Example: SKU "PA1012" → `/media/images/products/p/a/PA1012-image.jpg`
- Example: SKU "BD2345" → `/media/images/products/b/d/BD2345-thumb.jpg`
- This prevents directory bloat and maintains performance at scale.

## J) Styling & CSS Rules
- Tailwind CSS is the default styling system for apps/web.
- Global CSS (globals.css) is restricted to:
  - Tailwind base/components/utilities
  - CSS reset (if any)
  - Design tokens (CSS variables only)
- No page-specific or component-specific styles may be added to global CSS.
- All new UI must use Tailwind utilities or existing UI primitives.
- Do NOT introduce ad-hoc CSS Modules unless explicitly requested.
- Arbitrary Tailwind values (e.g. w-[317px]) are allowed only when required for fidelity.
- Repeated Tailwind patterns SHOULD be consolidated into components later, but NOT during initial page implementation.
